**Extracted Content Summary:**

**Project Title:** High-Resolution Climate Projections for Impact Assessment

**Principal Investigator:** Dr. Sarah Chen, Climate Dynamics Group

**Dataset Description:**
This dataset contains processed outputs from a 15-member CMIP6 model ensemble, downscaled to 0.5-degree resolution for regional climate impact studies. The simulations follow the RCP 4.5 moderate emissions scenario and include key variables for hydrological, agricultural, and infrastructure impact assessments.

**Methodology:**
- Initial conditions: Historical climate state (1980-2019)
- Forcing scenario: RCP 4.5 (stabilization at 4.5 W/m² by 2100)
- Ensemble members: 15 models from CMIP6 archive
- Downscaling method: Statistical downscaling using quantile mapping
- Bias correction: Applied using ERA5 reanalysis as reference

**Known Limitations:**
- Extreme event representation limited by spatial resolution
- Model uncertainty increases beyond 2080
- Sea ice processes simplified in tropical regions
- Urban heat island effects not explicitly represented

**Data Quality Notes:**
- All variables quality-controlled against physical constraints
- Outliers flagged but retained for transparency
- Missing data over ocean grid points for land-only variables
- Temporal consistency verified across all ensemble members

**Recommended Use Cases:**
- Regional climate change impact studies
- Infrastructure resilience planning
- Agricultural adaptation strategies
- Water resource management projections
- Coastal zone planning
